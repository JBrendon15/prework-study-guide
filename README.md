# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
I created this webpage to help me and other future bootcamp students to prepare for the bootcamp I will be in for learning how to code. This project helped me learn the basics of the tools that I will need in order for me to succeed in this bootcamp. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Github, and JavaScript. This will prepare me for deeper learning of these topics while I am in the bootcamp

You can open DevTools by right-clicking anywhere on the page, selecting 'Inspect', and selecting the 'Console' tab.  The JavaScript file will suggest a random topic to study first.
